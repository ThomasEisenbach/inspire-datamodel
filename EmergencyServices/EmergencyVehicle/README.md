# Readme

EmergencyVehicle is based on the FIWARE Vehicle (<https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.Transportation/tree/master/Vehicle>) data model but extends it with emergency-specific information. The extension is based in part on the EDXL-SitRep 1.0 ResouceDetail (4.5.1.1.1) <http://docs.oasis-open.org/emergency/edxl-sitrep/v1.0/cs02/edxl-sitrep-v1.0-cs02.pdf> data type.
